    The first industrial teleporter is unveiled. Being extremely large and requiring 
    enormous amounts of energy, it made them only suitable for factories, ports 
    and other manufacturing facilities.

    Further iterations bring the maximum range of the T1 to 10km, but it must be noted
    that the range was inversely proprortional to the mass of the target object.

    and packages.

    The entire logistical landscape is transformed, with almost all traditional 
    freight services being replaced by teleporter units. Transportation of goods is 
    no longer a bottleneck in the supply chain. Packaging waste is reduced. With the almost
    total annihilation of shipping, cargo and delivery services, unemployment rates are 
    at an all time high.
