During our stay in Monteverde we came across a post on social media about a turtle conservation project based in Carate, a tiny village one or two hours from Puerto Jimenez in the southern tip of the country. We had been interested in turtle consevation for a while so we decided to pull the trigger and go for it; the project was located near Corcovado National Park, which was already on our list so it was a no-brainer.

As such, we began the long and improvised journey down south...

# Quepos & Manuel Antonio
Even with a car, the journey to Puerto Jimenez is too long to complete in a single day. We figured we might as well stay in some towns along the Pacific Coast for a couple of days at a time and enjoy the beaches.

We took a bus heading to Puntarenas, at which point we had to switch to another one. We narrowly made it in time, the second bus arriving just after we stopped.

After a couple of hours we arrived in Quepos, a relatively small town known for its sports fishing. The marina was a hive of luxury yachts equipped for such activities -- but boats weren't the only thing swarming in the area -- hundreds of iguanas were casually chilling around in the surroundings.

Room prices were pretty steep in Quepos and options were limited. We found a small private room on Airbnb which saved us from the typically extortionate $20+ in a (shoddy) hostel. There really wasn't all that much to do in Quepos. On our second and last day there, we took the bus to Manuel Antonio: a nearby town with a long, placid beach ideal for families. This was clearly a beach enjoyed by the locals as well as the nearest beach for the capital dwellers.

The next day we continued with our journey...

# Uvita

Another bus trip later we ended up in Uvita. We wanted to make this stop because of the famous "whale tail" beach. Uvita started to cement what we had heard and experienced so far: the pacific coast of Costa Rica is far less developed. We felt like we had been dropped off somewhere very quiet and local... and that was the reality. There was no real town center, just a few establishments along the main highway that runs all the way down the pacific coast. 

Walking into the residential area lead us to our hostel. From there it was a 20 minute walk to the beach, which is actually a national park so there was an entrance fee of $5. That was a small price to pay to witness such a beautiful and unique beach. Its vastness, framed by vibrant palm trees from one end, made time stand still.

The tide had receeded far enough that you could walk along the entire length of the "whale's tail". There are thousands of hermit crabs and small fish swimming in the temporarily depleted waters; we even saw a small eel.

When the time comes in you are presented with what looks like two seas coming together, the waves from each side crashing over the spine of the tail sands.
