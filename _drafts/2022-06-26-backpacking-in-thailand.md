## Bangkok

After a delayed, long and uncomfortable economy flight, we arrived in Bangkok in the early evening. We passed immigration control, picked up our bags and bought SIM cards for the month ahead. Unlimited data for Â£23 probably wasn't the best deal ever but it was quick and easy. 


We ordered a Grab (Thailand's Uber) and had a relatively smooth ride to our hotel. As the driver approached the destination, I couldn't help but worry that we had booked something dodgy -- the neighbourhood seemed rough and loud, a concrete overpass looming over the dimly lit streets -- but a left turn followed by a right and a lush jungle revealed itself amidst the grey buildings. The hotel "courtyard" was like a hidden greenhouse, with fairy lights sprinkled amongst the trees, light reflecting off of the meandering koi pond.

### Temple (TODO Write name)

### Ayutthaya

Having only heard of the infamous temples of Ayutthaya, we decided to book a day trip to witness them in person. It was a pretty packed tour: we ended up visting a total of <<..X..>> temples as well as the <<...palace?...>>. The main temple, <<...>> was fascinating, though having already seen a bunch of similar stuppas and chedis the same day I have to admit we felt a little _templed out_ by the end of it. I was dissapointed that the guide didn't give us more historical information about the temples and instead just let us roam around by ourselves (this was a constant theme through the various tours we did in Thailand).

## Phuket (Kata)

Very quiet, Russian village

## Koh Phi Phi

Picturesque, beach ok, lots of shops/restaurants, nice to kayak

## Koh Phangan

Dakonda resort, full moon party 

## Koh Tao

Pretty, full of resources, beach is ok. Diving, snorkeling.

## Khao Sok

National park (lake) is ok. Cave was cool. Rain. Cockroach bungalow.

## Chiang Mai

Situated in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai was the last and probably one of our favourite cities we visited before leaving for Cambodia. It really was a charming old town, less busy and frantic than Bangkok, and a lot less party orientated than the islands. The old city is guarded by a not-so-ancient ancient wall, the streets inside it hosting a collection of hip cafes and kaleidoscopic temples. Just outside the gates, we found weekend markets; a Saturday and a Sunday one, the latter being much larger, but both worth a visit. Straying a little further northwest, we stumbled into the fancy neighbourhood of <<...>> which offers more expensive restaurants and bars, a lot of which appeared to be Japanese.

### Local hiking

On our first day here we rented a motorbike and rode a local hiking route, the Monk's Trail. It was a really pleasant walk with a gentle elevation which takes you to a small temple and meditation spot, with a quiet waterfall running through the middle of it all. We didn't expect to see so much from such a small trail.

On our second day we still had our trusty 110cc Honda Scoopi -- in hotrod red -- we rode 45 mins to another hiking trail, Mon Jing, in the mountain of Nang Mo. Despite only taking you to an elevation of 850m, this trail was hard. Not the hardest thing I've done my any means, by the gravelly terrain, paired with the scorching temperature made it intensive. Oh and did I mention the thousands of gigantic spiders? And snakes? Ok, we only saw one snake and it quickly slithered away into hiding but still... The orb weavers were actually everywhere, including in the middle of the path, so whilst you were constantly watching where you were stepping due to the horrible terrain you also had to look up every now and then to ensure that you don't walk face first into one of those monsters.
