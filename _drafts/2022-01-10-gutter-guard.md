Managing devs (or anyone?) is a lot like bowling.

As the more experienced dev, you are there to limit how much your colleagues' bowls end up in the gutter and ensure a strike.

For Junior devs you are the gutter guard and the ball roller thing; you'll get hit a lot but that's your job.

For medium devs who don't need the gutter guard any more or the ball roller, you are there to provide tips on technique.

For senior devs, you're there to reset the pins! (Does this make sense or just writing it cos it's funny?)
