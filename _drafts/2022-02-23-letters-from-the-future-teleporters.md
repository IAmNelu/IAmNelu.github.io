The year is 2367. You’re standing at a large plaza. Life, for the most part, looks exactly how it does now yet you can’t seem to shake off that uncanny valley feeling. Trees and greenery surround the facades of every coffee house, fast food joint and retail store. You start walking around the plaza, turning each corner only to find arrive at another square. You begin to put a finger on the source of that funny feeling: there are no roads. No cars. No trucks.

In **2013** scientists in [....] beat the previous teleportation record in an experiment which moved a [....] XX km across to another lab.

In **2099**, researchers managed to teleport 1 gram of pure iron 10 meters.

In **2145**, the first organic sample, a single E.Coli bacterium was successfully teleported on the other side of the globe, and continued to live for approximately 10 minutes.

In **2218**, we had a pandemic.

In **2224**, the first industrial teleporter was unveiled by [...], teleporting their stock price to never before seen levels.

The units were extremely large and required enormous amounts of energy, making them only suitable for factories, ports and other manufacturing facilities. The first model, the T1, had a maximum range of 10km, though this was mostly a marketing trick as the range scaled inversely with the weight of the object. In reality the biggest thing technicians could move the entire 10km was anything roughly the size and weight of a fat Labrador.

Speaking of dogs, the T1 was unable to handle organic matter, though that was a grey area. What constituted “organic” was debatable, even by scientific terms; you could teleport a wooden log, but if you wanted something to be alive on the other end, or anything you wanted to ingest thereafter, you’d be best to go for the more traditional route.

<!-- In a move widely considered controversial, Royal Mail became the largest adopter of the T1, replacing their entire internal infrastructure with several hundred units to move mail and packages between central depots. Perhaps predictably, government mishandling lead to the biggest ever customer payout when a T1 unit malfunctioned, sending millions of letters and packages to Canterbury... in New South Wales, Australia.

In **2230**, the entire logistical landscape is transformed, with almost all traditional freight services being replaced by T3s. Transportation of goods is no longer a bottleneck in the supply chain. Packaging waste is reduced. Fresher produce is more readily available. With the almost total annihilation of shipping, cargo and delivery services, unemployment rates are at an all time high.

By this time, several competing teleportation start-ups are fighting for a seat at table the but the throne remains under [...]'s control.

In the spring of **2233**, the first consumer-level teleporter is made available by a small German based start-up. The unit is capable of teleporting small objects to other units. As the hype settles, the lack of real-life use cases with this form factor finally hits home.

In **2239**, [...] announces the first ever teleporter capable for teleporting humans (and organic matter all round). The _Ascenda X10_, appears
