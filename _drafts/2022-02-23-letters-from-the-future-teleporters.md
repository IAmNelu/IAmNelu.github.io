The year is 2367. You’re standing at a large plaza. Life, for the most part, looks exactly how it does now yet you can’t seem to shake off that uncanny valley feeling. Trees and greenery surround the facades of every coffee house, fast food joint and retail store. You start walking around the plaza, turning each corner only to find arrive at another square. You begin to put a finger on the source of that funny feeling: there are no roads. No cars. No trucks.
