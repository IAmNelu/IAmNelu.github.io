## Siem Reap

At the start of July we flew from Bangkok to Siem Reap. We had already sorted out our 30-day e-visas, making entry pretty smooth, though the lack of tourists certainly helped. We also took a slight risk in not booking an exit flight, something that is stated as a requirement for entry, but evidently it isn't since we didn't get asked for one.

### Stress on arrival

We had organised a pick-up from the airport via our Airbnb host. I was a bit surpised that it was a tuk-tuk but it only cost $3 so no complaints there -- however -- we ended up having a somewhat stressful start to our trip here. Cambodia uses both the US dollar and the Cambodian Riel, neither of which we had on arrival. The 2 ATMs in the airport kept erroring out with our (Monzo) cards -- no problem, we're kind of used to this -- we just resort to our Revolut cards which tend to work better. 

Guess who had forgotten to top up their Revolut cards! And in order to top up we needed internet, for which we needed SIM cards... for which we needed to pay in cash!

Before realising that we hadn't topped up our driver patiently drove us into town to a few other ATMs which also didn't work, at which point we awkwardly had to explain that we needed SIM cards first. He very kindly offered to pay for a SIM card at a small shop, after which our problems were solved. We were a little annoyed to later find out that we got massively over-charged for the SIM card: $25 for 12GB of internet, for 30 days. For reference, the very same day we went to an official Cellcard shop and I got a 70GB SIM for just $11. But hey, it got us out of a pickle so who cares.

### Motorbike rental

We had booked this Airbnb months before our arrival and were a bit shocked to see how far away it is from town. We had clearly misjudged the distances on the map. A 30 min walk to the town center wasn't so bad the first day, but we quickly decided to rent a motorbike for a few days. I was quite shocked at the prices! But haggling is pretty much a must here in Cambodia. We managed to swing the price down to $8 a day. In return we received the shoddiest looking bike the shop had: it almost always failed to start on the first (or second, or third) time, had a broken left mirror, no under-seat storage and a broken spedometer! Oh and it had over 300,000km on it! Still, I have great respect for these little machines. They just seem to keep going.

Renting the motorbike was a great decision, since it allowed to explore the temple complex of Angkor in complete freedom...

##### A note on driving in Cambodia
> Two words: corner cutting.

> It's diabolical. Whether it's small roads or complex junctions, it's mayhem. Just go slowly and look in every direction. In some ways the chaos sorts itself out, but you are forced to be part of it, forced to cut corners and wiggle between cars.

> Another way to grasp the picture: Cambodia has outlawed driving with your lights on during the day, but there is no law requiring lights during the night!

### The Angkor Temple Complex

This is probably the first place I have visited in my travels that made the words *"must see before you die"* ring true and loudly.

We planned on saving Angkor Wat for last, since we had read that its magnificence overshadows the other temples. As such we planned to spending the first day exploring the temples inside Angkor Thom, Preah Khan, and Preah Neak Poan.

We rode to the ticket office (which is nowhere near the temples). We weren't sure if it was the right place as the vast parking lot was virtually empty. This was the first sign that the temples that awaited us will be practically devoid of any tourists. 

A 1-day ticket cost $37, but they had a promotion running that let you use the ticket for 2 days, which was perfect for us.

##### Guide or no guide?
> We opted to drive ourselves and not hire a guide, mostly because we had a guidebook and we have been somewhat let down by the guides in Thailand. I will admit though that the guides here, that always seem to be swarming you, sounded like they spoke very fluent and relatively sophisticated English. In these struggling times I did feel bad not hiring their services, but through experience I've found that I don't get much out of it. It's nice to learn more, yes, but I prefer the tranquility in exploring and immersing yourself in private. A few paragraphs in a guidebook will never be sufficient in describing the history of any place but it allowed us to strike a nice balance between knowledge and independence.

#### The walled city of Angkor Thom

After a scenic ride along the mostly straight roads, we passed through the South Gate of Angkor Thom, a few turns later arriving at the main entrance of **Bayon**, the temple of faces. Throughout the temple, countless faces emerge from the stonework, protected by an outer wall meticulously decorated with sprawling bas-reliefs depicting important events of ancient Khmer history and culture. Expecting crowds, we were stunned by the lack of people here. The eerie silence along with the hundreds of faces watching down on you resulted in a mind-bending experience. 

Next we drove to **Phimeanakas Temple** and did the short trail to **Baphuon** (typically it's done the other way round). Baphuon was another fantastic experience, seeing as we were mostly alone.

Looping back we walked along the **Terrace of the Elephants**, before hopping on our bike and heading to **Preah Khan**. A much "flatter" construction, but what it lacks in height it makes up for with its maze-like corridors so perfectly aligned they give the illusion that you're in a hall of mirrors.

Finally, we rode to **Preah Neak Poan**. One of the smaller but rather unusual temples, in that it is a simple, small tower that sits in an enclave of moats.

#### Angkor Wat

We arrived around noon, where the plan was to avoid the morning crowds (that come here for the sunrise) and spend the day exploring the temple, popping over to **Ta Prohm** and coming back to Angkor Wat for sunset.

There were markedly more people here than the other temples, but most were actually Cambodians. A common thing to do here for locals is to dress up in traditional Khmer clothing and take photos at the temple. It was also a Saturday, so I imagine that it would have been even emptier on a weekday.

Angkor Wat is indeed huge. What makes Khmer architecture beautiful is its excess. An excess that is present both in the decorative sense and embedded into the base structure. Even the small libraries, with an interior no larger than a modern living room, stand on elevated multi-level platforms. Every inch of stone is intricately decorated with Hindu and Buddist carvings, which is made more impressive when you let the size of the temple sink in. Borrowing from the guide book we had, it's simply *"devotion etched in stone"*.

It cannot be overstated how surreal it felt to be there practically alone. We couldn't understand why but I suppose most of the visitors were busy taking pictures in the courtyard outside the main building. To have this ancient wonder of the world all to ourselves was special.

I have to admit however that it all somehow felt a bit flat, underwhelming. Every piece of literature speaks, if not shouts, about the prowess of the temple -- when you look at the scale, the quality of the carvings, the architectural and logistical undertaking by the thousands of workers/slaves, all taking place in the 12th century -- then it's easy to understand why this site is considered monumental. So to explain the cognitive dissonance here, I think it's because of something counter-intuitive: restoration and conservation. Though the other temples in the complex have recieved some attention, they look and feel much older (and some are in fact older). Some, like Ta Prohm, have been engulfed by the jungle, giving them the romanticised look of ancient ruins that I expected. To put it simply, Angkor Wat has been preserved and restored so well that it takes a departure from common expecations, or at least, my own.

This is not to say that we weren't appreciative of the exprience. I don't say this lightly: you must see this place before you die.
