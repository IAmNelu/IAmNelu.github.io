# My Bookshelf
At the start of 2022 I set myself a goal to get into the habit of reading. As a child, my exposure to books was mostly in the form of encyclopedias (what a nerd); I hardly ever ready any _novels_. 

Following the advice from _Atomic Habits_, I decided to chain this new habit to an existing one: drinking my morning coffee. It has worked tremendously well. I've read more books this year than the previous 10 combined. It also helps that my work does a montly book club which encourages me to read at least 1 book a month.

Since I mostly read on a Kindle, I thought a creating a virtual bookshelf of sorts might be a fun CSS exercise. The following is mostly pure CSS and HTML, with a little bit of Javascript to add randomisation. I could've opted for no JS at all if I offloaded the randomness as part of the data driven design, but hey.

If you want to incorporate this into your own website you can find the repo here.
