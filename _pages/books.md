# My Bookshelf
<small>
At the start of 2022 I set myself a goal to get into the habit of reading.

Following the advice from _Atomic Habits_, I decided to chain this new habit to an existing one: drinking my morning coffee. It has worked tremendously well. I've read more books this year than the previous 10 combined. It also helps that my work does a montly book club which encourages me to read at least 1 book a month.

Since I mostly read on an e-reader (and sometimes listen to audiobooks), I thought that creating a virtual bookshelf of sorts might be a fun exercise. The following is mostly pure CSS and HTML, with a little bit of Javascript to add randomisation.
