Hi, I'm Petar. I am a software developer based in London. I quit my job to start my own company, [Makely](https://makely.me).

When I'm not working I am day-dreaming of travelling the world and owning a little wood workshop. Currently trying to learn Spanish. For the 5<sup>th</sup> time.

You can get in touch with me at **pgyurov93** at **gmail** dot **com**

## Education
### Royal Holloway, University of London (2012 - 2015)
**BSc Theoretical Physics** <cite>&mdash; 1<sup>st</sup> Class Honours (1:1)</cite>

For my major project I simulated a [Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephson_effect) with
a side exploration into the [Nyquist–Shannon Sampling Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem). Simulation written in C++ and data visualisation was performed with Python.

## Work
### [Makely](https://makely.me) (08/2019 - Present)
**Founder, Developer** <cite>&mdash; Python, Flask, AWS, ReactJS, PostgreSQL</cite>

Makely is a 3D printing platform that connects everyday people to 3D printing enthusiasts and hobbyists, allowing them to print their ideas with virtually zero knowledge of the tech. 
I am currently the sole developer. Looking to release sometime between Q4 2020 and Q1 2021. If you are interested, drop me an email.

### Splash Damage (08/2017 - 08/2019)
**Backend Engineer** <cite>&mdash; Python, Flask, Golang, C#, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL</cite>

Developed the backend for the PC game Dirty Bomb and an another unannounced project. The live-service nature of the games required the backend(s) to be flexible, with low overhead on new features and reliable scaling.

Added a machine learning aspect to the feedback analysis for Dirty Bomb. Prototyped an analytics pipeline to handle events for all of the company's titles.
